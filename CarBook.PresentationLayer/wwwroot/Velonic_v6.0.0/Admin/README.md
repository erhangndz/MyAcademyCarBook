# Velonic - Responsive Admin Template & UI Kit
We would like to thank you for purchasing Velonic :). The following guideline will help you to get started with the Velonic and its documentation.

#### Docs and Examples

The `docs` directory contains all the static resources required for docs and examples. To view, just open in your favorite browser!

```
$ open docs/index.html
```
Once you open the documentation. Just click on `Getting Started` link from left, this would open up the page (`docs/getting-started.html`) containing instructions to get started with setup. Optionally, you can review quick setup guide described below.

#### Gulp

We've included Gulp file (gulpfile.js) to help you get started with the theme and build automation. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js. Note that the detailed instructions are available in `docs/index.html` too.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - Recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts the local server serving the theme.
+ `gulp docs` - starts local server serving the documentation.
+ `gulp build` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` folder.

#### Support
